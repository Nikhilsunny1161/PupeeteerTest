the checkout process on the Sauce Demo website using Puppeteer, a Node library for controlling headless Chrome or Chromium browsers.

I have used javascript with puppeteer for following action that i needed to perform


The script performs the following actions:
1.Launches a browser and opens the Sauce Demo website.
2.Logs in with predefined credentials.
3.Navigates to a specific product and adds it to the cart.
4.Proceeds to the checkout page.
5.Fills out the checkout form with personal details.
6.Completes the checkout process by clicking the "Finish" button.

Prerequisites-:
Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:
1.Node.js (version 12 or higher)
2.Puppeteer (a Node library for controlling headless Chrome)

Install Puppeteer using npm:
by command  "npm install puppeteer"

Troubleshooting
